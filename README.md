</details>

**Make sure to read [instructions file](./instructions.txt)**

# Source code.

**Follow the instructions to compile and run the program corrrectly.**

### Compiling instructions.

**To compile and run the program easily just run `compileAndRun.bat` file.**

<details> <summary> To compile the program only (without version or icon) </summary>

1) Open the command-line.

2) Type `g++ -o Terminally main.cpp includes/rgb.h -lWinmm` and hit enter.

Now you are ready to run the program.
</details>

<details> <summary> To compile the program with the icon and version info </summary>

1) You have to install mingw64 and add it to path.

2) Navigate to the source code folder and open the command-line there.

3) Type `windres icon.rc -O coff -o ICON.res` to compile the icon file.

4) Type `windres ver.rc -O coff -o VER.res` to compile the version file.

5) Type `g++ -o Terminally main.cpp includes/rgb.h ICON.res VER.res -lWinmm` to compile the program with the version and the icon files.
</details>

<details> <summary> To customize the icon </summary>
  
1) Open `icon.rc` file.

2) Type `id ICON "ICON.ico"` in the `icon.rc` file (You can replace `ICON.ico` with any `.ico` file.

*example:`id ICON "pathToTheIcon/example.ico"`*).

3) Type `windres icon.rc -O coff -o ICON.res` to compile the icon file (You can replace `icon.rc` with the name of the `.rc` file you created and 
you can replace `ICON.res` with the name of the output file you want *example:`windres icon.rc -O coff -o example.res`* but the file must be a `.res` file).

4) Compile the icon file with the program or compile both the icon and version file with the program by typing
`g++ -o Terminally main.cpp includes/rgb.h ICON.res VER.res -lWinmm` in the command line.
</details>

<details> <summary> To customize the version </summary>

1) Open `ver.rc` file.

2) Customize fields like ``VALUE "Type", "A basic C++ Command-line Shell"`` **<-- this string can be editable**.

3) You can also change both `FILEVERSION     1,7,13,21`**<--** and `PRODUCTVERSION  1,7,13,21`**<--**.

4) Open the command line and type `windres ver.rc -O coff -o VER.res` to compile the version file (You can replace `ver.rc` with the name of the `.rc` file you created and 
you can replace `VER.res` with the name of the output file you want *example:`windres ver.rc -O coff -o example.res`* but the file must be a `.res` file).

5) Compile the version file with the program or compile both the icon and version file with the program by typing
`g++ -o Terminally main.cpp includes/rgb.h ICON.res VER.res  -lWinmm` in the command line.

<details> <summary> RGB to hexadecimal guide </summary>

- "To convert an RGB value to a Hexadecimal color :" 
 
- let's say we wanna convert this RGB value to a haexadecimal color "rgb(120,45,203)"
 
- let's say that the first number which is red is X
 
- the second one which is green is Y
 
- and the third one which is blue is Z
 
- we will convert x,y and z separately.
 
- let's convert X to a hexadecimal
 
- "the law = X/16,X/16 = int.float , hex = #int and float*16"
 
- so coverting X will be equal to:
 
- result = X/16
 
- result = 120/16 = 7.5
 
- converting the decimal floating point: 0.5 * 16 = 8
 
- so the hex will be equal to #780000
 
- Note:
 
- 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,(10 is A),11 is B,12 is C,13 is D,14 is E,15 is F
 
- so converting Z will be
 
- result = Z/16
 
- result = 203/16 = 12.6875 and 12 is equal to C
 
- converting the decimal floating point: 0.6875 * 16 = 11 and 11 is equal to B
 
- so the hex will be equal to #BA0000
 
- and x y and z = #782DCB

# **Important note:**

***Please don't remove the following files from the Terminally.exe directory :*** `Data.dat` And `audio.prop`.
  
***The -lWinmm command used in mingw64 is for the sound of the shell***
  
***The includes/rgb.h used in mingw64 is for the rgb functions***
